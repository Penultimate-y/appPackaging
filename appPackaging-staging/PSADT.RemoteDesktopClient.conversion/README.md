# Remote Desktop Client - PSADT v4.1.8 Win32 App

Downloads and installs the current release of Remote Desktop Client at deployment time.

Built with **PSAppDeployToolkit v4.1.8**, generated from the
`PSADT.Kiro.IDE` template by `new.psadt-package.ps1`.


## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Package** | `PSADT.RemoteDesktopClient.conversion` |
| **Vendor** | Microsoft |
| **Architecture** | x64 |
| **Category** | Productivity |
| **Install context** | System |
| **Installer type** | MSI |
| **Silent switches** | `ALLUSERS=1` |
| **Replaces (legacy)** | `legacy.Remote Desktop` |

AVD/Windows 365 desktop client (msrdcw.exe).

## How the installer is obtained

1. If any `.msi`, `.exe` or `.zip` file is present in `Files\`, that file is used.
2. Otherwise: Vendor evergreen URL: `https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2139369`

The download lands in the PSADT-managed support-files folder and is cleaned up with the
session, so nothing is left behind on the device.

## Offline / air-gapped use

Drop the vendor installer into `Files\` before building the `.intunewin`. The package
then installs without any outbound network access and the resolver is never called.

## Test group requirement

App assignment changes affect every targeted device and user. Before widening an
assignment:

1. Assign to the **DWX application pilot group** only.
2. Confirm install, detection and uninstall on at least one device per supported Windows build.
3. Review `C:\Windows\Logs\Software\Remote Desktop Client (Latest)_*.log`.
4. Only then extend the assignment.

## Packaging

```powershell
.\IntuneWinAppUtil.exe `
    -c "<repo>\PSADT.RemoteDesktopClient.conversion" `
    -s "Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.exe" `
    -o "<output folder>" `
    -q
```

## Logging

```
C:\Windows\Logs\Software\Remote Desktop Client (Latest)_Latest_<DeploymentType>_<timestamp>.log
```

## Update strategy

This package is evergreen: each run resolves and installs whatever the vendor currently
publishes. To push an update, trigger a sync or re-assign in Intune - the package itself
does not need to be rebuilt.

Exception: resolvers of type `PinnedUrl` do **not** auto-resolve. For those, update the
URL in `psadt-app-catalog.json` and regenerate:

```powershell
.\new.psadt-package.ps1 -PackageName 'PSADT.RemoteDesktopClient.conversion' -Force
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Install fails immediately | PSADT log under `C:\Windows\Logs\Software\`; confirm outbound HTTPS and proxy/TLS inspection allow the vendor host |
| "Resolved an empty download URL" | Vendor changed their endpoint or index layout. Update the resolver in the catalog and regenerate |
| "post-install verification failed" | The silent switches installed to a different path than detection expects. Compare the log's install path against the detection path |
| Detection never reports installed | Run `Detect-RemoteDesktopClient.ps1` manually on the device and check its exit code |
